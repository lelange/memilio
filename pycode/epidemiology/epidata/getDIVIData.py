@brief Data of the DIVI
about Sars-CoV2 is downloaded.
This data contains the number of Covid19 patients in intensive care
and the number of those that are additionally ventilated.

DIVI - Deutsche interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin

data explanation:
- reporting_hospitals is the number of reporting hospitals
- ICU is the number of covid patients in reporting hospitals
- ICU_ventilated is the number of ventilated covid patients in reporting hospitals
- free_ICU is the number of free ICUs in reporting hospitals
- occupied_ICU is the number of occupied ICUs in in reporting hospitals

ID_County and ID_State is defined by the "Amtlicher Gemeindeschlüssel (AGS)"
which is also used in the RKI data as ID_County and ID_State
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Landkreise_in_Deutschland.

Specific features about the data:
The column "faelle_covid_im_bundesland" exits only in the data from the first day (24.4)
The column ICU does not exist for the 24.4.
ICU_ventilated does not exist for the 24.4. and 25.4.

    This function checks if the given date is a key of a dictionary where dates
    and their corresponding call_numbers are stored.
    This is stored there if the difference of the call_number to the call_number of the date before is larger than
    1 or 2.
    If the date is not part of the call_number_dict the new call_number is calculated.
    First, the last_number is successively increased by one until a difference of 300 is reached.
    Then, the last_number is successively decreased by one until a difference of 300 is reached.
    At last the last_number without a change is tried.
    If data could be downloaded by the function call_call_url and the difference was 1 or 2,
    the data is simply given back.
    If the difference is different an additional message is printed in the end of the program,
    which can be used to copy the date and the corresponding call_number directly into the call_number_dict
    to decrease runtime of the program.
    Furthermore, in this function another specific part of the url, the call_time, is estimated from the given date.
    If the date is before 2020-6-5 the time "-09-15" and afterwards "-12-15" has to be added to the date.
    Moreover for dates in the range [2020-6-12, 2020-6-5], an additional "-2" has to be added after the call_time.

    """!Function to get the divi data.

    Available data start from 2020-4-24.
    If the given start_date is earlier, it is changed to this date and a warning is printed.
    If it does not already exist, the folder Germany is generated in the given out_folder.
    If read_data == True and the file "FullData_DIVI.json" exists, the data is read form this file
    and stored in a pandas dataframe.
    Otherwise the program is stopped.

    If update_data == True  the same happens as for read_data == True.
    Furthermore, if the last date in read data is yesterday, the data of today is downloaded.
    For this download an easier link can be used than the one where we have to find the mysterious call_number.
    If the data has not yet been uploaded, the program is stopped with a message to try again later.
    If there is more data missing than today, the parameter start_date is changed to the first missing data,
    and the data is normally downloaded (see below).

    If data should normally be downloaded between start_date and end_date, we start with an empty pandas dataframe.
    Afterwards, for every day between start_date and end_date, both included,
    the function download_data_for_one_day is called.
    If a given back dataframe is empty, a warning is printed that this date is missing, but the program is not stopped.
    If start_date is earlier or equal 2020-04-29, the function adjust_data has to be called.
    If data has been downloaded, the dataframe of this one date is added to the dataframe with all dates.

    If the dataframe which should contain all data is empty after going through all dates, the program is stopped.
    Otherwise the dataframe is written to the file filename = "FullData_DIVI".
    Than the columns are renamed to English and the state and county names are added.
    Afterwards, three kinds of structuring of the data are done.
    We obtain the chronological sequence of ICU and ICU_ventilated
    stored in the files "county_divi".json", "state_divi.json"and "germany_divi.json"
    for counties, states and whole Germany, respectively.

    @param read_data False [Default] or True. Defines if data is read from file or downloaded.
    @param file_format File format which is used for writing the data. Default defined in defaultDict.
    @param update_data "True" if existing data is updated or
    "False [Default]" if it is downloaded for all dates from start_date to end_date.
    @param out_folder Folder where data is written to.
    @param no_raw True or False [Default]. Defines if unchanged raw data is saved or not.
    @param start_date [Optional] Date to start to download data [Default = 2020.4.24].
    @param end_date [Optional] Date to stop to download data [Default = today].
